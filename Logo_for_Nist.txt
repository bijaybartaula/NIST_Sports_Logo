I’m an NIST alumnus from my pre-university days, so when a college friend reached out for assistance with this 
competition, I couldn’t turn it down. It’s a valuable opportunity to contribute to a purposeful initiative at 
my former school, support the Health and Sports Club, and encourage creativity among students.
It’s been a while, hasn’t it?

When I learned about the Health and Sports Club’s Logo Drawing Competition, I was eager to assist my old classmates. 
I’m designing a logo to enter, hoping to help one of you secure the victory!

Here’s my plan:
I’m creating a logo that reflects the Health and Sports Club’s core—health, fitness, and sports—while incorporating 
Nist’s identity through the “NC” theme. According to the guidelines, it must be original, simple, and effective in 
black and white, so I’m focusing on a clear, striking design. I’ll submit it in JPEG format as required.

I’d love your input:
If you have thoughts or suggestions about the club’s essence or what Nist’s spirit truly represents, please share them 
with me. My goal is to craft a logo we can all take pride in. 
Let’s rekindle that classic Nist energy and win this for the team!

Looking forward to reconnecting soon!
